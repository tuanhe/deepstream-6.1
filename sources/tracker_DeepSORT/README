This sample shows how to use a re-identification model for multi-object tracking
like DeepSORT on dGPU and Jetson.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-requisites:
- Visit official DeepSORT GitHub repo https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort
  In section "Installation", there is a link to the pre-trained re-identification
  model. Download the model file `networks/mars-small128.pb` and place it under
  the current directory `sources/tracker_DeepSORT/`.
- Generate UFF model from TensorFlow frozen graph. The generation process can be
  done on both dGPU and Jetson; or the UFF model can be generated on dGPU first
  and copied to Jetson.
  1. Make sure TensorRT's uff-converter-tf and graphsurgeon-tf packages are installed.
  2. Install tensorflow-gpu (version 1.15 recommended) for python3:
     For dGPU:
       $ pip install tensorflow-gpu
     For Jetson, refer to https://elinux.org/Jetson_Zoo#TensorFlow
  3. Run provided script to convert the model:
     $ python3 convert.py mars-small128.pb
- Copy converted file to destination location on dGPU or Jetson.
  mkdir /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/samples/models/Tracker/ &&
  cp mars-small128.uff /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/samples/models/Tracker/
  Make sure the UFF file path is consistent with `uffFile` in DeepSORT config.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run the sample:
- Enter `samples/configs/deepstream-app/`. In deepstream-app config, change
  [tracker] config to use DeepSORT:
  ll-config-file=config_tracker_DeepSORT.yml
  DeepSORT tracker parameters are in `config_tracker_DeepSORT.yml`.
- Run deepstream-app
  deepstream-app -c <path to config.txt>
