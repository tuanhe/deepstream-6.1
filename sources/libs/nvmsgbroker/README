nvmsgbroker library can be used to make connections with multiple external brokers.
This library acts as a wrapper around the message adapter libraries(kafka,Azure,redis,amqp)
provides its own APIâ€™s and implements certain features like autoreconnection applicable for
all the message adapters.

Configuration
--------------
configurations applicable for nvmsgbroker library are listed in cfg_nvmsgbroker.txt
1. auto-reconnect
    Used to automatically attempt reconnection when connection with broker is down
    To enable : auto-reconnect=1
    To Disable: auto-reconnect=0
2. retry-interval
    Specify reconnection interval in seconds
3. max-retry-limit
    Specify reconnection max retry limit in seconds

NOTE:
Default nvmsgbroker library settings are as below.
You can override them by specifying different values in cfg_nvmsgbroker.txt
    1. auto-reconnect is enabled by defualt
    2. retry-interval=2
    3. max-retry-limit=360

Dependencies
-------------
The msgbroker library dynamically loads protocol adapters passed as a paramter during
connection creation. Also connection string and/or a message protocol adapter library
specific cfg file is passed as paramater during connection creation.
Please see documentation for the adapter libraries for their specific requirements.

The following information is expected for each protocol:
  - Path to the protocol adapter library
    The libraries are found under /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/lib:
    Kafka: libnvds_kafka_proto.so
    AMQP: libnvds_amqp_proto.so
    Azure Device Client: libnvds_azure_proto.so
    Redis: libnvds_redis_proto.so

  - Protocol-specific Connection string and/or configuration file
    See README for each of the supported protocols:
    Kafka: /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/sources/libs/kafka_protocol_adaptor
    AMQP: /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/sources/libs/amqp_protocol_adaptor
    Azure Device Client: /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/sources/libs/azure_protocol_adaptor
    Redis: /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/sources/libs/redis_protocol_adaptor

Sample Application
-------------
This sample application demonstrates usage of libnvds_msgbroker.so.
The nvds_msgbroker library provides access to various messaging protocol adapter
libraries through a common facility.

This sample application tests the following protocols:
  - Kafka
  - AMQP
  - Azure IoTHub Device
  - Redis

To build the application:
  $ make -f Makefile.test

To run the application:
  $ ./test_msgbrokerlib

The application tests a series of operations (connect/send/subscribe/disconnect)
on each of aforementioned protocols. One thread is launched for each protocol test.
All threads are launched simultaneously and hence the order in which the tests are
launched may vary each time the app is run

NOTE:
1. There can be simultaneous multiple connections with external brokers.
    ex: connection 1 : kafka (localhost)
        connection 2 : kafka (kafka broker on remote host)
        connection 3 : Azure (Azure IotHub)
2. The protocol-specific config file has a "share-connection" config. If you want to allow
the connection created to be shared with an other component within the same process,
uncomment the line share-connection=1 in cfg file
3. If there are 2 tests with each attempting to connect with the same connection params,
same protocol adapter library and if share-connection=1 , just one connection is created
internally and the same connection handle is returned to the both the callers(threads)
