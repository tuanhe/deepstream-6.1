*****************************************************************************

===============================================================================
1. Prerequisites:
===============================================================================

Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app/README on how
to install the prequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and the
apps. Also, please read the information about the Gst-NvDsUcx plugin within the
Deepstream SDK.

This test requires the availability of an NVIDIA ConnectX-6 DX or later NIC.
For more information on installing and configuring NICs, please see:
https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/ConnectX6VPI/Introduction

To be able to run the test over an RDMA-enabled network, please
ensure you have also installed the RDMA OFED network stack from here:
https://network.nvidia.com/products/infiniband-drivers/linux/mlnx_ofed/. The
installation instructions can be found here:
https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/MLNXOFEDv551032/Installing+MLNX_OFED.

Also, install the Unified Communication-X Library from here:
https://github.com/openucx/ucx. The installation instructions are mentioned here:
https://github.com/openucx/ucx#release-builds. Please note, that UCX library
should be compiled with CUDA support by adding the --with-cuda=<path/to/cuda> 
to the configure command:

$ ./contrib/configure-release --prefix=/install/path --with-cuda=/path/to/cuda

You must have the following development packages installed
   GStreamer-1.0
   GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins
   GStreamer-1.0 gstrtspserver
   X11 client-side library

To install these packages, execute the following command:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
   libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev libx11-dev

Install the plugins provided by the Gst-NvDsMetaUtils library, see below.

===============================================================================
2. Purpose:
===============================================================================

This document shall describe about the sample deepstream-ucx-test2 application.

The deepstream-ucx-test2 application is meant for a simple demonstration of how
to use the new communication plugin called nvdsgst_ucx with the Deepstream SDK
along with the new custom serialization and deserialization library called
libnvds_video_metadata_serialization.so. Please consult the documentation for the
Gst-NvDsMetaUtils library that utilizes these libraries.

===============================================================================
3. To compile:
===============================================================================

  $ Set CUDA_VER to 11.6 for x86.
  $ sudo make

Note, the nvdsgst_ucx plugin is not supported on Jetson.

===============================================================================
4. Usage:
===============================================================================

To run:
  1. This test utilizes a custom library to serialize and deserialize the
     metadata generated by the nvinfer plugin. Ensure that you have compiled
     the video_metadata_serialization library in the gst-nvdsmetautils folder.

     For installing the plugins provided by Gst-NvDsMetaUtils, do the following
     on both client and server machines:

     $ cd /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/sources/gst-plugins/gst-nvdsmetautils/video_metadata_serialization
     $ make and sudo make install

  2. This application requires the new nvstreammux plugin. Before the server or
     client is started, the environment variable USE_NEW_NVSTREAMMUX=yes must
     be set on the command line.

     $ export USE_NEW_NVSTREAMMUX=yes

  3. Run the server application first. Required parameters (in order) are the
     IP address of server, Port, Height of frame in video, Width of frame in
     video, Path to the video metadata serialization
     (libnvds_video_metadata_serialization.so) library, Path to output file.
     For example,

     $ ./deepstream-ucx-test2-app-server 192.168.100.1 4000 1920 1080 \
     /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.1/lib/libnvds_video_metadata_serialization.so \
     /path/to/output_file.mp4

  4. Run the client application next. Required parameters (in order) are the
     IP address of server, Port on server, Path to the nvinfer config, Path to the
     video metadata serialization library, Path to video file. For example,

     $ ./deepstream-ucx-test2-app-client 192.168.100.1 4000 ~/config_infer_primary.txt \
     /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.1/lib/libnvds_video_metadata_serialization.so \
     /path/to/file.mp4

NOTE: To compile the sources, run make with "sudo" or root permission.

The Deepstream pipeline here consists of the streammux plugin that takes input
from the filesrc after decoding. The streammux passes the frames to the nvinfer plugin
that identifies certain objects in the frames and add that metadata to the frame. The
serialization plugin (part of the Gst-NvDsMetaUtils library) creates a binary object
corresponding to the metadata and adds to the frame. The nvdsgst_ucx plugin here is
used in reverse mode where the client side acts as the sink and sends the frame and
the binary metadata over RDMA network to the server side of plugin.

Here, we show the server side of the plugin that acts as the source and receives data
from the client. The server then forwards the data to the deserialization plugin
(part of the Gst-NvDsMetaUtils library) which extracts it to append the metadata
correctly to the frame. The nvdsosd plugin interprets the metadata and passes it to
the videoconverter to convert to the right format. Then to the encoder and filesink
for output.
