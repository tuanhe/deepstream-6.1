===============================================================================
1. Prerequisites:
===============================================================================

Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app/README on how
to install the prerequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and
the apps.

You must have the following development packages installed
   GStreamer-1.0
   GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins
   GStreamer-1.0 gstrtspserver
   X11 client-side library

To install these packages, execute the following command:

   libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev libx11-dev

#Deepstream msgbroker supports sending messages to Azure(mqtt) IOThub, kafka and AMQP broker(rabbitmq)

Dependencies
------------

Azure Iot:
 ----------
    Refer to the README files available under
    /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/sources/libs/azure_protocol_adaptor
    for detailed documentation on prerequisites and usages of Azure protocol
    adaptor with the message broker plugin for sending messages to cloud.

 Kafka:
 ------
    Refer to the README file available under
    /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/sources/libs/kafka_protocol_adaptor
    for detailed documentation on prerequisites and usages of kafka protocol
    adaptor with the message broker plugin for sending messages to cloud.

 AMQP (rabbitmq):
 ----------------
    Install rabbitmq-c library
    --------------------------
    Refer to the README file available under
    /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/sources/libs/amqp_protocol_adaptor
    for detailed documentation on prerequisites and usages of rabbitmq based
    amqp protocol adaptor with the message broker plugin for sending messages to cloud.

 Model (PeopleSegNet) Requirements:
 ------------------------------
    Download the TAO 3.0 model files:
    -----------------------------------
    Please refer https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_reference_apps/tree/master/deepstream_app_tao_configs#1-download-the-config-files to get the models.
    TRT plugin Build from OSS requirement:
    --------------------------------------
    PeopleSegNet depends on GenerateDetection, MultilevelCropAndResize,
    MultilevelProposeROI TRT plugins which are not supported by TensorRT 8.x native package.
    So user shall build and update TensorRT OSS Plugin - libnvinfer_plugin.so

    Please Follow instructions at:
    - https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_tao_apps/tree/master/TRT-OSS/Jetson for Jetson
    - https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_tao_apps/tree/master/TRT-OSS/x86 for x86

    NOTE: For Jetson, while running CMake from the above link, add `-DGPU_ARCHS="53 62 72 75"` flag since by default TRT-OSS selects
    SM architectures `53 62 70 75` which does not include sm72 required for Jetson AGX.

    More details could be found at https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_reference_apps/blob/master/deepstream_app_tao_configs/README.md

SETUP:
  1.Use --proto-lib or -p command line option to set the path of adaptor library.
    Adaptor library can be found at /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/lib

    kafka lib           - libnvds_kafka_proto.so
    azure device client - libnvds_azure_proto.so
    AMQP lib            - libnvds_amqp_proto.so

  2.Use --conn-str command line option as required to set connection to backend server.
    For Azure           - Full Azure connection string
    For Kafka           - Connection string of format:  host;port
    For Amqp            - Connection string of format:  host;port;username;password

    Provide connection string under quotes. e.g. --conn-str="host;port;topic;password"

  3.Use --topic or -t command line option to provide message topic

  4.Use --schema or -s command line option to select the message schema (optional).
    Json payload to send to cloud can be generated using different message schemas.
    schema = 0; Full message schema with separate payload per object (Default)
    schema = 1; Minimal message with multiple objects in single payload.
    Refer user guide to get more details about message schema.

  5.Use --no-display to disable display.

  6.Use --cfg-file or -c command line option to set adaptor configuration file.
    This is optional if connection string has all relevent information.

    For kafka: use cfg_kafka.txt as a reference.
    This file is used to define the parition key field to be used while sending messages to the
    kafka broker. Refer Kafka Protocol Adaptor section in the DeepStream Plugin Manual for
    more details about using this config option. The partition-key setting within the cfg_kafka.txt
    should be set based on the schema type selected using the --schema option. Set this to
    "sensor.id" in case of Full message schema, and to "sensorId" in case of Minimal message schema


    For Azure , use the cfg_azure.txt as a reference. It has the following section:
        [message-broker]
        #connection_str = HostName=<my-hub>.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=<device_id>;SharedAccessKey=<my-policy-key>
        #custom_msg_properties =  <key>=<value>;
        #share-connection=1

        Azure device connection string:
        -------------------------------
        You can provide the connection_str within cfg_azure.txt of format:
        connection_str = HostName=<my-hub>.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=<device_id>;SharedAccessKey=<my-policy-key>

        OR

        you can pass in full connection string with --conn-str option

    For AMQP, use cfg_amqp.txt as reference. It has the following default options:
        [message-broker]
        password = guest
        hostname = localhost
        username = guest
        port = 5672
        exchange = amq.topic
        topic = topicname
        #share-connection=1

        AMQP connection string:
        ----------------------
        Provide hostname, port, username, password details in the cfg_amqp.txt

        OR

        you can pass in full connection string with --conn-str option in format: "hostname;port;username;password"

  NOTE:
    - DO NOT delete the line [message-broker] in cfg file. Its the section identifier used for parsing
    - Share connection
      ----------------
      #share-connection=1
      Uncomment the field share-connection in cfg_*.txt and set its value to 1
      if you need to generate a connection signature. This signature is a unique string
      which is generated by parsing all the connection related params used for making a connection.
      Uncommenting this field signifies that the connection created can be shared
      with other components within the same process.

  7. Enable logging:
       Go through the README to setup & enable logs for the messaging libraries(kafka, azure, amqp)
         $ cat ../../../tools/nvds_logger/README

NOTE: Due to deprecation of OpenCV, the binary of this app is not packaged,
to use this application, follow the compilation steps mentioned below.

===============================================================================
2. Purpose:
===============================================================================

This document shall describe about the sample deepstream-mrcnn-test application.

This sample builds on top of the deepstream-test1 sample to demonstrate how to:

* Use "nvmsgconv" and "nvmsgbroker" plugins in the pipeline.
* Create NVDS_EVENT_MSG_META type of meta and attach to buffer.
* Use NVDS_EVENT_MSG_META for different types of objects e.g. vehicle, person etc.
* Provide copy / free functions if meta data is extended through "extMsg" field.


===============================================================================
3. To compile:
===============================================================================

  $ Set CUDA_VER in the MakeFile as per platform.
      For Jetson, CUDA_VER=11.4
      For x86, CUDA_VER=11.6

        Password:   <password (or API key) from your NGC account>

  Deployment modules:
  Add new module:
  - Name:    ds

  - Image URI:
        For x86 dockers:
            docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/deepstream:<tag>-devel
            docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/deepstream:<tag>-samples
            docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/deepstream:<tag>-iot
            docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/deepstream:<tag>-base
            docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/deepstream:<tag>-triton

        For Jetson dockers:
            docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/deepstream-l4t:<tag>-samples
            docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/deepstream-l4t:<tag>-iot
            docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/deepstream-l4t:<tag>-base

  - container Create options:
         {
           "HostConfig": {
             "Runtime": "nvidia",
           },
           "WorkingDir": "/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/sources/apps/sample_apps/deepstream-mrcc-test",
           "ENTRYPOINT":
           [
            "/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/bin/deepstream-mrcnn-test",
            "-i", "/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/samples/streams/sample_720p.h264",
            "-p",
            "/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/lib/libnvds_azure_edge_proto.so",
            "--no-display",
            "-s",
            "1",
            "--topic",
            "mytopic"
           ]
         }

  - specify route options for the module:

    option 1) Default route where every message from every module is sent upstream
    {
      "routes": {
        "route": "FROM /messages/* INTO $upstream"
      }
    }

    option 2)  you can mention specific routes where messages sent upstream based on topic name
    ex: in the sample test programs, topic name "mytopic" is used for the module name ds
    {
      "routes": {
        "route": "FROM /messages/modules/ds/outputs/mytopic INTO $upstream",
      }
    }
#Start the edge runtime and verify if modules are running:
---------------------------------------------------------

  #Restart the iotedge on your system
  sudo systemctl restart iotedge

  #Give it a few seconds

  #check edge runtime status
  systemctl status iotedge

  #List the modules running
  sudo iotedge list

  #check output from the modules
  sudo iotedge logs ds

"nvmsgconv" plugin uses NVDS_EVENT_MSG_META type of metadata from the buffer
and generates the "DeepStream Schema" payload in Json format. Static properties
of schema are read from configuration file in the form of key-value pair.
Check dsmrcnn_msgconv_config.txt for reference. Generated payload is attached
as NVDS_META_PAYLOAD type metadata to the buffer.

"nvmsgbroker" plugin extracts NVDS_META_PAYLOAD type of metadata from the buffer
and sends that payload to the server using APIs in nvmsgbroker C library.

Generating custom metadata for different type of objects:
In addition to common fields provided in NvDsEventMsgMeta structure, user can
also create custom objects and attach to buffer as NVDS_EVENT_MSG_META metadata.
To do that NvDsEventMsgMeta provides "extMsg" and "extMsgSize" fields. User can
create custom structure, fill that structure and assign the pointer of that
structure as "extMsg" and set the "extMsgSize" accordingly.
If custom object contains fields that can't be simply mem copied then user should
also provide function to copy and free those objects.

Refer generate_event_msg_meta() to know how to use "extMsg" and "extMsgSize"
fields for custom objects and how to provide copy/free function and attach that
object to buffer as metadata.

NOTE: This app by default sends message for first object of every 30th frame. To
change the frequency of messages, modify the following line in source code accordingly.
if (is_first_object && !(frame_number % 30)) should be changed to:
if (!(frame_number % 30))  //To get all objects of a single frame
