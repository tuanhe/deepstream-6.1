===============================================================================
1. Prerequisites:
===============================================================================

Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app/README on how
to install the prequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and the
apps.

You must have the following development packages installed
   GStreamer-1.0
   GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins
   GStreamer-1.0 gstrtspserver
   X11 client-side library

To install these packages, execute the following command:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
   libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev libx11-dev

===============================================================================
2. Purpose:
===============================================================================

This document shall describe about the sample deepstream-user-metadata-test application.

It is meant for demonstration of how to set, access user metadata for DeepStream SDK
elements in the pipeline and extract meaningful insights from a video stream.

===============================================================================
3. To compile:
===============================================================================

  $ Set CUDA_VER in the MakeFile as per platform.
      For Jetson, CUDA_VER=11.4
      For x86, CUDA_VER=11.6
  $ sudo make

===============================================================================
4. Usage:
===============================================================================

  $ ./deepstream-user-metadata-test <h264_elementary_stream>

NOTE: To compile the sources, run make with "sudo" or root permission.

This sample creates instance of "nvinfer" element. Instance of
the "nvinfer" uses TensorRT API to execute inferencing on a model. Using a
correct configuration for a nvinfer element instance is therefore very
important as considerable behaviors of the instance are parameterized
through these configs.

For reference, here are the config files used for this sample :
1. The 4-class detector (referred to as pgie in this sample) uses
    dstest1_pgie_config.txt

In this sample, one instance of "nvinfer" referred as the pgie, is created.
This is a 4 class detector and it detects for "Vehicle , RoadSign, TwoWheeler,
Person".

nvinfer element attaches 16 random integers as user metadata to frame metadata.
Refer "nvinfer_src_pad_buffer_probe" function in the sample code.
By attaching the probe function at the end of the pipeline, one can extract
all the 16 integers which are attached as user metadata.
Refer the "osd_sink_pad_buffer_probe" function in the sample code.
For details on the Metadata format, refer to the file "nvdsmeta.h"

Expected output:
Metadata attached on nvinfer source pad probe function should match with
metadata received on nvosd sink pad.
