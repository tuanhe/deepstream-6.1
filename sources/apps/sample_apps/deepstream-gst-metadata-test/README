===============================================================================
1. Prerequisites:
===============================================================================

Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app/README on how
to install the prequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and the
apps.

You must have the following development packages installed
   GStreamer-1.0
   GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins
   GStreamer-1.0 gstrtspserver
   X11 client-side library

To install these packages, execute the following command:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
   libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev libx11-dev

===============================================================================
2. Purpose:
===============================================================================

This document shall describe about the sample deepstream-gst-metadata-test application.

It demonstrates, how to set metadata before nvstreammux
component, how to access it after nvstreammux component for DeepStream SDK
elements in the pipeline and extract meaningful insights from a video stream.

===============================================================================
3. To compile:
===============================================================================

  $ Set CUDA_VER in the MakeFile as per platform.
      For Jetson, CUDA_VER=11.4
      For x86, CUDA_VER=11.6
  $ sudo make

===============================================================================
4. Usage:
===============================================================================

  $ ./deepstream-gst-metadata-test <h264_elementary_stream>

NOTE: To compile the sources, run make with "sudo" or root permission.

This sample creates instance of "nvinfer" element. Instance of
the "nvinfer" uses TensorRT API to execute inferencing on a model. Using a
correct configuration for a nvinfer element instance is therefore very
important as considerable behaviors of the instance are parameterized
through these configs.

For reference, here are the config files used for this sample :
1. The 4-class detector (referred to as pgie in this sample) uses
    dstest1_pgie_config.txt

In this sample, one instance of "nvinfer" referred as the pgie, is created.
This is a 4 class detector and it detects for "Vehicle , RoadSign, TwoWheeler,
Person".

In this sample, one instance of "nvv4l2decoder" is created.
nvv4l2decoder element is present before nvstreammux element in the pipeline.
nvdecoder_src_pad_buffer_probe() attaches dummy decoder metadata to gstreamer
buffer on src pad. The decoder can not attach its metadata to NvDsBatchMeta
metadata because batch level metadata is created by nvstreammux component.
The metadata is attached using gstnvdsmeta API's. Refer to
nvdecoder_src_pad_buffer_probe() function in source code.

This sample also explains how nvv4l2decoder can propagate gst metadata attached before it.
To demonstrate this, h264parse_src_pad_buffer_probe() attaches parser frame number as metadata
to gstreamer buffer on src pad of h264parse element. Refer to h264parse_src_pad_buffer_probe()
function in source code.

nvstreammux component, upon receiving gst buffer at its sinkpad, transforms
gst meta attached by decoder and h264parse elements into nvds user metadata at frame level.
In this way we maintain the association of frame metadata attached before
and after nvstreammux element.

In the example, nvinfer_src_pad_buffer_probe() extracts the metadata
received on nvinfer src pad.
It demonstrates following
a. The mechanism to access transformed decoder metadata.
b. The mechanism to access the metadata attached before decoder. It is similar to (a).

Expected output:
gst Metadata attached on nvv4l2decoder source pad probe function should match with
transformed nvds user metadata at frame level received on nvinfer src pad.

gst Metadata attached on h264parse source pad probe function should match with
transformed nvds user metadata at frame level received on nvinfer src pad.
