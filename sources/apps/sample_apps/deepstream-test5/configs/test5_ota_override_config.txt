# Provide the model-engine-file and labelfile-path of newly built model
# One of the use-case is that newly built model will have better accuracy compared to previous model
# Testing :- Here we are using the same model which we lauched during the deepstream-test5-app for
# demonstrating model-update OTA functionlity
